# Marketing Data Analysis

This project involves a comprehensive data analysis of marketing data using Python libraries such as pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib, and re. The dataset includes columns capturing demographic and transactional information about customers, such as id, YearBirth, Education, MaritalStatus, Income, Kidhome, Teenhome, DtCustomer, Recency, MntWines, MntFruits, MntMeatProducts, MntFishProducts, MntSweetProducts, MntGoldProducts, NumDealsPurchases, NumWebPurchases, NumCatalogPurchases, NumStorePurchases, NumWebVisitsMonth, AcceptedCmp3, AcceptedCmp4, AcceptedCmp5, AcceptedCmp1, AcceptedCmp2, Response, Complain, and Country. The goal of this project is to clean and visualize the data to uncover insights and trends, such as customer purchasing behavior, response to marketing campaigns, and demographic influences on spending patterns.

The analysis involves several steps: data cleaning to handle missing values and ensure accurate data types, exploratory data analysis (EDA) to generate descriptive statistics, and data visualization to understand distributions, relationships, and patterns. For instance, we create visualizations like histograms to show the distribution of income and scatter plots to explore relationships between different variables. By analyzing the data, we aim to answer key questions such as the distribution of customer income, purchasing behaviors across different demographics, and the effectiveness of marketing campaigns. These insights can help businesses tailor their marketing strategies to better meet the needs and preferences of their customers.
